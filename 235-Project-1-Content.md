## Gameplay

μKarts (MicroKarts) plays like any other top-down vehicle game; the arrow keys are used for movement and space is for the handbrake. MicroKarts also has a car upgrading system that allows you to upgrade things such as the speed, acceleration, and handling.

## Proposal

μKarts (MicroKarts) is a new take on old 2D top-down racing games such as Retro Racing where you must race against other players or against a time. Unlike some of those old racing games, μKarts features an upgrade system that allows players to tune and refine their vehicle until they become unstoppable.
